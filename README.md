# Machine Learning 2 Final Project Repository

## Overview 

The goal of this project was to predict the outcome of all hypothetical matchups between both mens and womens NCAA teams in order to correctly predict each stage of the NCAA March Madness Tournaments. The task was to forecast the probability of one team beating another across all possible matchups for the 2025 tournaments. This task was originally taken on as an independent project during the semester, and was submitted to the March Machine Learning Mania Kaggle competition. After the competition the project was continued and improved upon for final presentation and submission. 

## Data

The primary dataset this project uses was provided by Kaggle as a measure of the competition, and can be reproduced as long as one has a Kaggle account and signs up for the same competition. This data included historical results for mens and womens teams for both the regular season and tournament. The dataset also provided data on coaches win records, conference results, etc. For a comprehensive descriptions of the data please visit the [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2025/data).
